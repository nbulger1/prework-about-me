      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi...Welcome! Currently I am a fitness coach with a Masters in Sports Science. My past includes a Bachelors in Chemistry, a career background in prehospital medical research, an EMT certification, and gymnastics coaching. I have lived in Minnesota and New York...don't really recommend either compared to Washington.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Seattle, WA and grew up in Bellevue</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love the classic PNW activities including hiking, camping, and backpacking. I am also an avid runner and aspiring triathlete...but really I just want to sleep most of the time</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>That is a very good question. Still figuring that out like a classic 25 year old millenial (zillenial technically but whatever)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Kirkland, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always loved math (retired mathlete here) and I never got a chance to explore computer science in college, but it has always fascinated me. Hopefully this exploration proves successful...</p>
